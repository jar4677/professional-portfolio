        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>It has been a long road which has led me to this point in my varied career. I've spent time as an
            Architectural Drafter, Retail Manager, Pastor, and most recently Data Analyst. Through all of these
            experiences I have learned a great deal about myself, what kind of work I enjoy, and in which
            environments I thrive.</p>
        <p>All of that has led me to a career as a software developer. I discovered the existence of intensive
            developer training courses and jumped at the opportunity. With all honesty, I can say that I've never
            made a better career decision in my life.</p>
        <h3>Why I am taking this course</h3>
        <p>In my time as a Systems/Data Analyst I was exposed to software development and had the opportunity to
            engage in some programming myself. I discovered that the days I spent writing a complex macro in Excel
            were my favorite days. When I found out that there were intensive, hands-on programs where I could learn
        programming technologies, I knew that was the path for me. Learning-Fuze stood out among the local options
            and I could nto be happier with my decision to learn here.</p>
        <h3>What type of job I want to get</h3>
        <p>After quite a bit of reflection and soul searching I have come to a conclusion about the kind of job I
            want and it is relatively simple.</p>
        <p>I want to work for someone who knows more than I do, who loves to share what they know, and together we
            make things that help others be successful.</p>
