        <p>I am a Junior Software/Web Developer in Orange County, California. I am passionate about using the
            fantastic technologies which are now available to create applications which solve real-world problems. I
        love to help people achieve their goals, streamline their work, and generally make their lives better.</p>
        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>It has been a long road which has led me to this point in my varied career. I've spent time as an
            Architectural Drafter, Retail Manager, Pastor, and most recently a Systems/Data Analyst. Through all of
            these experiences I have learned a great deal about myself, what kind of work I enjoy, and in which
            environments I thrive.</p>
        <p>In my time as a Systems/Data Analyst I was exposed to software development and had the opportunity to
            engage in some programming myself. I discovered that the days I spent writing a complex macro were my
            favorite days. When I found out that there were intensive, hands-on programs where I could learn programming
            technologies, I knew that was the path for me.</p>
        <h3>My Career Goals</h3>
        <p>After quite a bit of reflection and soul searching I have come to a conclusion about the kind of career I
            want and it is relatively simple.</p>
        <p>I want to work in a collaborative, positive environment, with people who are passionate about what they do,
            and together we make things that help others be successful.</p>
